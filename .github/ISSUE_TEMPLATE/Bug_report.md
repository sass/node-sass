Before opening an issue:

- Check that the version of node-sass you're trying to install supports your version of Node by looking at the release page for that version https://github.com/sass/node-sass/releases
- If you're running the latest verions of Node, you'll likely need the latest node-sass, we don't backport support to old versions of node-sass
- Read the common workarounds in https://github.com/sass/node-sass/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md
